# Discord Bot for the card game Secret Hitler
This is a simple Discord Bot for the political (and in my opinion highly entertaining and educational) card game [Secret Hitler](http://secrethitler.com/).
Go check out this awesome game and support the creators!

## Getting Started
Add the bot to your server [here](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=702048291780558870&permissions=67631168&scope=bot).

In a text channel, type `start`. You will need 5-10 people to play. The rest should be self explanatory.
